# njeeny 

## Introduction

njeeny is a simple php command line tool that allows you to create sensible and secure nginx configuration files.

## Installation

Right now it's not even functional. I will write some instructions once the first working version is out.

## Misc

Well, I need to update this readme file at some point.
