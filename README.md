# njeeny 

## Introduction

njeeny is a simple php command line tool that allows you to create sensible and secure nginx configuration files.

## Installation

Right now it's not even functional. I will write some instructions once the first working version is ready.

## Miscellaneous

### Todo

Well, I need to update this readme file at some point.

### Gotchas/Requirements

- I'm using a multidimensional array as a constant so I guess PHP7+ is required.

I'll try to keep a minimal list of requirements (no libraries, no composer, no nothing).

The only things that are required, you should already have anyways (since you're running Wordpress/Drupal sites).

### Current Testing Environment

- Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
- PHP 7.0.22
- nginx/1.10.3
